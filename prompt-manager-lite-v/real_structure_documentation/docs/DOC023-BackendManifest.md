## 🎯 Service Catalog Overview

### Service Catalog Philosophy

Our backend service catalog follows modern microservices architecture principles and serves as the central registry for all backend components. This catalog enables:

#### 🔍 **Service Discovery & Visibility**
- **Unified service registry** with comprehensive metadata
- **Real-time service health** and status monitoring
- **Dependency mapping** and impact analysis
- **API documentation** and contract management

#### 🚀 **Developer Self-Service**
- **Service scaffolding** with standardized templates
- **Automated deployment** pipelines and environments
- **Configuration management** and secret handling
- **Testing and validation** frameworks

#### 📊 **Operational Excellence**
- **Service ownership** and responsibility tracking
- **SLA monitoring** and performance metrics
- **Incident management** and escalation procedures
- **Capacity planning** and resource optimization

### Service Classification

Our services are organized into logical domains and tiers:

#### **Service Tiers**
- **Tier 1 (Critical):** Core business services with 99.9% SLA
- **Tier 2 (Important):** Supporting services with 99.5% SLA  
- **Tier 3 (Standard):** Utility services with 99% SLA
- **Tier 4 (Development):** Development and testing services

#### **Service Types**
- **Business Services:** Core business logic and domain services
- **Platform Services:** Shared infrastructure and utility services
- **Integration Services:** External system integrations and adapters
- **Data Services:** Data processing, storage, and analytics services
