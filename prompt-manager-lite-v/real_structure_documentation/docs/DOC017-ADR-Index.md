## üéØ ADR Overview

### What are Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle. Each ADR documents the context, decision, and consequences of a single architectural choice, providing a historical record of why decisions were made and their expected impact.

### Our ADR Philosophy
- **Transparency:** All architectural decisions are documented and accessible
- **Accountability:** Clear ownership and rationale for each decision
- **Learning:** Capture lessons learned and decision outcomes
- **Collaboration:** Inclusive decision-making process with stakeholder input
- **Evolution:** Decisions can be revisited and updated as context changes

### Benefits of ADRs
- **Knowledge Preservation:** Maintain institutional knowledge across team changes
- **Decision Traceability:** Understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Onboarding Acceleration:** Help new team members understand system design
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identify and document architectural trade-offs
- **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from past decisions and outcomes
