## 🎯 Project Organization Philosophy

### Modern Repository Principles

Our project structure follows 2025 industry best practices for maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly codebases:

#### 🔍 **Discoverability & Navigation**
- **Intuitive hierarchy** with clear separation of concerns
- **Consistent naming** following established conventions
- **Self-documenting structure** where purpose is clear from organization
- **Quick reference** through comprehensive manifest documentation

#### 🚀 **Developer Experience**
- **Fast onboarding** with clear structure and documentation
- **Efficient workflows** with optimized tooling and automation
- **Reduced cognitive load** through logical organization
- **Scalable architecture** supporting team growth and project evolution

#### 🛡️ **Maintainability & Quality**
- **Separation of concerns** with clear boundaries between different aspects
- **Version control optimization** with appropriate .gitignore and file organization
- **Automated quality checks** integrated into the development workflow
- **Documentation co-location** keeping docs close to relevant code

### Organization Principles

#### **Domain-Driven Structure**
- **Feature-based organization** grouping related functionality together
- **Business domain alignment** reflecting organizational structure
- **Clear ownership** with team responsibility boundaries
- **Modular architecture** enabling independent development and deployment

#### **Convention Over Configuration**
- **Standardized patterns** reducing decision fatigue
- **Predictable locations** for common file types and functionality
- **Automated tooling** leveraging consistent structure
- **Team alignment** through shared conventions and practices
