## üîÑ Code Review Process

### Our Code Review Philosophy

Code review is not just about catching bugs‚Äîit's our primary mechanism for knowledge transfer, maintaining code quality, and building team cohesion. We approach reviews as collaborative learning opportunities where everyone grows together.

### Graduated Review Process

Your code review experience will evolve as you gain confidence and expertise:

- **Detailed Feedback:** Extensive comments explaining the "why" behind suggestions
- **Pair Programming:** Live review sessions to discuss changes in real-time
- **No Time Pressure:** Take time to understand and ask questions
- **Celebration Focus:** Emphasize what you did well, not just what needs improvement

**Example Review Comments:**
```
‚úÖ Great job using TypeScript interfaces here! This makes the code much more maintainable.

üí° Consider extracting this logic into a custom hook. Here's why: [explanation]
   Example: [code sample]
