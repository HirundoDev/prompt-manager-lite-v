## 🔄 Semantic Versioning & Automation

### Semantic Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with automated version management:

#### **Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

```
MAJOR: Breaking changes that require user action
MINOR: New features that are backward compatible
PATCH: Bug fixes and security patches
```

#### **Pre-release Identifiers**
- **Alpha:** `1.2.3-alpha.1` - Early development versions
- **Beta:** `1.2.3-beta.1` - Feature-complete but potentially unstable
- **RC:** `1.2.3-rc.1` - Release candidates ready for production

### Automated Versioning with Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate version bumping:

#### **Commit Message Format**
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### **Version Bump Rules**
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Major version bump
- **feat:** Minor version bump
- **fix:** Patch version bump
- **docs, style, refactor, test, chore:** No version bump

#### **Example Commit Messages**
```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
fix(auth): resolve login timeout issue

# Minor release (1.0.1 → 1.1.0)
feat(api): add user profile endpoints

# Major release (1.1.0 → 2.0.0)
feat(auth)!: migrate to OAuth 2.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication now requires OAuth 2.0 tokens
```

### Automated Release Tools

#### **Semantic Release Configuration**
```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",

## 🚀 Progressive Delivery Strategies

### Canary Deployments

Canary deployments gradually expose new versions to increasing percentages of users:

#### **Canary Rollout Schedule**
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Initial Canary"
    traffic_percentage: 5%
    duration: 15m
    success_criteria:
      - error_rate < 0.1%
      - response_time_p95 < 500ms
      
  - name: "Expanded Canary"
    traffic_percentage: 25%
    duration: 30m
    success_criteria:
      - error_rate < 0.05%
      - response_time_p95 < 400ms
      
  - name: "Full Rollout"
    traffic_percentage: 100%
    success_criteria:
      - error_rate < 0.01%
      - response_time_p95 < 300ms
```

#### **Canary Implementation**
- **Traffic Splitting:** Istio service mesh or AWS ALB weighted routing
- **Monitoring:** Real-time metrics collection and analysis
- **Automated Promotion:** Metrics-based progression through stages
- **Rollback Triggers:** Automatic rollback on threshold violations

### Blue-Green Deployments

Blue-green deployments maintain two identical production environments:

#### **Blue-Green Process**
1. **Deploy to Inactive Environment** (Green)
2. **Run Smoke Tests** on Green environment
3. **Switch Traffic** from Blue to Green
4. **Monitor Performance** on Green environment
5. **Keep Blue as Rollback** option for immediate recovery

#### **Infrastructure Requirements**
- **Identical Environments:** Same capacity, configuration, and dependencies
- **Load Balancer Control:** Instant traffic switching capability
- **Database Compatibility:** Schema changes must be backward compatible
- **Health Check Integration:** Automated validation before traffic switch

### Feature Flags

Feature flags provide runtime control over feature activation:

#### **Flag Types and Usage**
- **Release Flags:** Control feature rollout to user segments
- **Experiment Flags:** A/B testing and gradual feature exposure
- **Operational Flags:** Circuit breakers and performance toggles
- **Permission Flags:** Role-based feature access control

#### **Flag Management Best Practices**
```javascript
// Feature flag implementation example
const featureFlags = {
  newUserDashboard: {
    enabled: true,
    rollout: {
      percentage: 50,
      userSegments: ['beta_users', 'premium_users']
    }
  },
  advancedAnalytics: {
    enabled: false,
    rollout: {
      percentage: 0,
      userSegments: []
    }
  }
};
```

#### **Flag Lifecycle Management**
- **Creation:** Clear naming conventions and documentation
- **Rollout:** Gradual exposure with monitoring
- **Cleanup:** Automated removal of obsolete flags
- **Audit:** Regular review of active flags and their usage

```javascript
// Disable feature flag immediately
featureFlags.updateFlag('newFeature', {
  enabled: false,
  rollout: { percentage: 0 }
});
```

##### **4. Database Rollback**
```sql
-- Execute pre-prepared rollback script
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Rollback schema changes
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN new_field;
-- Rollback data changes
UPDATE users SET status = 'active' WHERE status = 'verified';
COMMIT;
```
