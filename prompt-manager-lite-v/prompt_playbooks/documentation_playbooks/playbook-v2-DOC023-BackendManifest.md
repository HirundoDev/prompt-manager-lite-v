## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Organizations
1. **Start with service registry** - establish central service catalog
2. **Implement API gateway** - centralize traffic management and security
3. **Add observability stack** - comprehensive monitoring and logging
4. **Establish governance** - service standards and compliance frameworks

### For Existing Organizations
1. **Audit current services** - inventory and categorize existing services
2. **Standardize documentation** - consistent service specifications
3. **Implement service mesh** - improve communication and observability
4. **Enhance developer experience** - self-service tools and automation

### For Microservices Migration
1. **Domain modeling** - identify bounded contexts and service boundaries
2. **Gradual decomposition** - incremental migration from monolith
3. **Data consistency** - manage distributed data and transactions
4. **Service communication** - implement async messaging and event sourcing

## Customization Guidelines

### By Architecture Pattern
- **Microservices:** Comprehensive service catalog with mesh integration
- **Modular Monolith:** Service-oriented documentation within monolith
- **Serverless:** Function catalog with event-driven architecture
- **Hybrid:** Mixed patterns with clear service boundaries

### By Organization Size
- **Startups (1-50):** Focus on essential services and rapid development
- **Scale-ups (51-500):** Balance governance with development velocity
- **Enterprises (500+):** Comprehensive governance and compliance frameworks

### By Industry
- **Financial Services:** Enhanced security and regulatory compliance
- **Healthcare:** HIPAA compliance and data protection requirements
- **E-commerce:** High availability and performance optimization
- **SaaS:** Multi-tenancy and customer isolation requirements
