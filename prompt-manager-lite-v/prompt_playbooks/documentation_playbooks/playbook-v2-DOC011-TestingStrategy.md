generator = TestGenerator()

test_suite = generator.generate_tests(
    requirements=requirements_text,
    test_type="integration",
    framework="pytest",
    coverage_target=0.95
)
```

### Shift-Left Implementation
```javascript
// Test-Driven Development example
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  test('should authenticate user with valid credentials', async () => {
    const user = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123' };
    const result = await authService.authenticate(user);
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.token).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Self-Healing Tests
```javascript
// Self-healing test implementation
class SelfHealingTest {
  async findElement(selector, context) {
    try {
      return await this.page.$(selector);
    } catch (error) {
      const newSelector = await this.aiElementDetector.findSimilarElement({
        originalSelector: selector,
        context: context,
        screenshot: await this.page.screenshot()
      });
      
      if (newSelector) {
        await this.healingStrategies.updateTestCase(selector, newSelector);
        return await this.page.$(newSelector);
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Testing
```javascript
// K6 load testing example
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 }
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.05']
  }
};
```

## Advanced Features

### Predictive Test Analytics
```python
# AI-powered test failure prediction
class PredictiveTestAnalytics:
    def predict_test_failures(self, code_changes, test_suite):
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(
            code_changes=code_changes,
            test_history=self.get_test_history()
        )
        
        predictions = self.ml_model.predict_proba(features)
        
        return {
            'high_risk_tests': [
                test for test, prob in zip(test_suite, predictions)
                if prob[1] > 0.7
            ],
            'recommended_actions': self.generate_recommendations()
        }
```

### Security Testing Integration
```javascript
// Automated security testing
describe('Security Tests', () => {
  test('should prevent SQL injection', async ({ request }) => {
    const maliciousInputs = [
      "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
      "1' OR '1'='1"
    ];
    
    for (const input of maliciousInputs) {
      const response = await request.post('/api/search', {
        data: { query: input }
      });
      
      expect(response.status()).toBe(400);
    }
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing
```javascript
// Automated accessibility validation
test('should not have accessibility violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  
  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
    .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa'])
    .analyze();
  
  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Data Factory
```javascript
// Comprehensive test data generation
class TestDataFactory {
  static createUser(overrides = {}) {
    return {
      id: faker.string.uuid(),
      email: faker.internet.email(),
      firstName: faker.person.firstName(),
      lastName: faker.person.lastName(),
      password: 'TestPassword123!',
      ...overrides
    };
  }
  
  static createCompleteWorkspace() {
    const users = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => this.createUser());
    const projects = Array.from({ length: 3 }, () => this.createProject());
    const tasks = projects.flatMap(project => 
      Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => this.createTask({ projectId: project.id }))
    );
    
    return { users, projects, tasks };
  }
}
```
