# Playbook: DOC005-FrontendDependencies.md

## Document Purpose
Create comprehensive frontend dependency management documentation following 2025 best practices, focusing on security-first approach, automated monitoring, performance optimization, and supply chain protection.

## 2025 Best Practices Integration

### Security-First Approach
- **Zero-tolerance policy** for critical vulnerabilities in production
- **Automated security scanning** with npm audit, Snyk, and Socket Security
- **Supply chain protection** with package integrity verification
- **Immediate response protocols** for security incidents

### Modern Package Management
- **npm 10.x with Node.js 22.x** for latest security and performance features
- **Lock file management** with package-lock.json for deterministic builds
- **Package manager configuration** with .npmrc optimization
- **Automated dependency updates** with Dependabot and security patches

### Performance Optimization
- **Bundle size monitoring** with webpack-bundle-analyzer and bundlephobia
- **Tree shaking optimization** for minimal bundle impact
- **Performance budgets** with size limits and monitoring
- **Alternative evaluation** for heavy dependencies

## Key Implementation Guidelines

### Security Configuration
```json
// package.json security settings
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "security:scan": "npx snyk test",
    "security:monitor": "npx snyk monitor"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22.0.0",
    "npm": ">=10.0.0"
  }
}
```

### .npmrc Configuration
```ini
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
save-exact=true
package-lock=true
audit-level=moderate
fund=false
prefer-offline=true
progress=false
```

### Dependabot Configuration
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "frontend-team"
```

### Security Audit Automation
```bash
# Daily security checks
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Enhanced scanning with Snyk
npx snyk test --severity-threshold=medium

# Supply chain security
npx @socketsecurity/cli scan

# License compliance
npx license-checker --failOn 'GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0'
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Bundle analysis
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/static/js/*.js

# Package size check before install
npx bundlephobia [package-name]

# Dependency tree analysis
npm ls --depth=0

# Update checking
npx npm-check-updates --interactive
```

## Vulnerability Response Workflow

### Severity-Based Response Times
- **Critical:** < 24 hours - Immediate patch and deployment
- **High:** < 48 hours - Priority patch with testing
- **Moderate:** < 1 week - Scheduled patch in next release
- **Low:** Next maintenance cycle - Planned update

### Response Process
1. **Detection:** Automated scanning identifies vulnerability
2. **Assessment:** Evaluate impact and exploitability
3. **Mitigation:** Apply patches or implement workarounds
4. **Testing:** Validate fixes don't break functionality
5. **Deployment:** Release security updates
6. **Monitoring:** Watch for issues post-deployment

## License Compliance Management

### Acceptable Licenses (Low Risk)
- MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD-3-Clause
- Commercial use allowed, no copyleft requirements

### Restricted Licenses (High Risk)
- GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0
- Copyleft requirements, legal review needed

### Compliance Tools
```bash
# Generate license report
npx license-checker --summary --out licenses.json

# Check for problematic licenses
npx license-checker --failOn 'GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0'

# Create attribution file
npx license-checker --customPath format.json > ATTRIBUTIONS.md
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

- **Target:** Initial bundle < 200KB, total < 1MB
- **Monitoring:** Regular bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- **Optimization:** Code splitting, tree shaking, dynamic imports
- **Alternatives:** Evaluate lighter packages for heavy dependencies

### Dependency Selection Criteria
- **Bundle impact:** Prefer smaller, tree-shakeable packages
- **Maintenance:** Active development and security updates
- **Popularity:** High download counts and community adoption
- **Quality:** Good documentation and TypeScript support

## Automation and Monitoring
