# Playbook: DOC010-Deployment.md

## Document Purpose
Create comprehensive deployment documentation following 2025 DevOps best practices, focusing on GitOps workflows, progressive delivery, immutable infrastructure, and comprehensive observability for modern cloud-native applications.

## 2025 Best Practices Integration

### Modern DevOps Approaches

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
RUN apk update && apk upgrade
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs

// Application Metrics
import prometheus from 'prom-client';

const httpRequestDuration = new prometheus.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
  buckets: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10]
});

export const metricsMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = (Date.now() - start) / 1000;
    httpRequestDuration.observe({
      method: req.method,
      route: req.route?.path || req.path,

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.data.status).toBe('healthy');
  });

  test('Database connectivity', async () => {
    const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/api/health/database`);
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.data.database).toBe('connected');
  });
});
```

```javascript
// K6 Load Test
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.05'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  let response = http.get('https://api.company.com/health');
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
}
```
