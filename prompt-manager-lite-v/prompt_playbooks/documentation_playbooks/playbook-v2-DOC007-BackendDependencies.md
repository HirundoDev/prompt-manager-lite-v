```ini
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
save-exact=true
package-lock=true
audit-level=moderate
fund=false
prefer-offline=true
progress=false
engine-strict=true
```

### Multi-Tool Security Scanning
```bash
# Comprehensive security scanning approach
npm audit --audit-level=moderate --production
npx snyk test --severity-threshold=medium
npx @socketsecurity/cli scan
npx @npm/malware-scanner scan
npx license-checker --failOn 'GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0'
```

### AI-Enhanced Vulnerability Management
```typescript
// Automated vulnerability response system
interface VulnerabilityResponse {
  id: string;
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low';
  package: string;
  version: string;
  fixAvailable: boolean;
  aiRiskScore: number;
  businessImpact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  autoFixRecommended: boolean;
}

class VulnerabilityManager {
  async processVulnerability(vuln: VulnerabilityResponse): Promise<void> {
    const aiAssessment = await this.aiRiskAssessment(vuln);
    
    if (vuln.severity === 'critical' && vuln.autoFixRecommended) {
      await this.autoFix(vuln);
      await this.runSecurityTests();
      await this.deployIfTestsPass();
    } else {
      await this.createSecurityTicket(vuln, aiAssessment);
    }
  }
}
```

### Supply Chain Security
```typescript
// Maintainer reputation and package validation
interface MaintainerScore {
  packageName: string;
  maintainerEmail: string;
  reputationScore: number; // 0-100
  factors: {
    accountAge: number;
    packageCount: number;
    downloadCount: number;
    securityIncidents: number;
    communityFeedback: number;
    verificationStatus: boolean;
  };
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  recommendation: 'approve' | 'review' | 'reject';
}

class SupplyChainValidator {
  async validatePackage(packageName: string): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    const maintainerScore = await this.getMaintainerScore(packageName);
    const packageIntegrity = await this.verifyPackageIntegrity(packageName);
    const malwareCheck = await this.scanForMalware(packageName);
    
    return {
      approved: this.shouldApprove(maintainerScore, packageIntegrity, malwareCheck),
      riskFactors: this.identifyRiskFactors(maintainerScore, packageIntegrity),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(maintainerScore)
    };
  }
}
```

## Vulnerability Response Workflow

### Severity-Based Response Times (2025)
- **Critical:** < 4 hours - AI-powered immediate response with auto-patching
- **High:** < 24 hours - Priority review with automated testing
- **Moderate:** < 1 week - Scheduled batch updates with validation
- **Low:** Next maintenance cycle - Planned updates with documentation

### AI-Enhanced Response Process
1. **Detection:** AI-powered vulnerability scanning identifies issues
2. **Assessment:** Machine learning risk analysis with business context
3. **Decision:** Automated decision making for low-risk fixes
4. **Implementation:** Auto-patching with comprehensive testing
5. **Validation:** Automated security and functionality testing
6. **Deployment:** Intelligent deployment with rollback capabilities
7. **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring with anomaly detection

## License Compliance Management

### Risk-Based License Categories
- **Low Risk:** MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD-3-Clause (Commercial use allowed)
- **Medium Risk:** LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0 (Requires legal review)
- **High Risk:** GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0 (Copyleft requirements)
- **Critical Risk:** AGPL-3.0, SSPL-1.0 (Prohibited for commercial use)

### Automated Compliance Tools
```bash
# License compliance automation
npx license-checker --summary --out licenses.json
npx license-checker --failOn 'GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0;SSPL-1.0'
npx @license-ai/scanner analyze
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Memory and Performance Monitoring
- **Target:** < 512MB memory usage at runtime
- **Monitoring:** Real-time memory profiling with clinic.js
- **Optimization:** Lazy loading, tree shaking, bundle splitting
- **Validation:** Automated performance testing in CI/CD

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive performance analysis
npx clinic doctor -- node dist/main.js
npx clinic bubbleprof -- node dist/main.js
npx cost-of-modules --no-install
```

## Automation and Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring (2025)
```typescript
// Dependency health monitoring with AI
class DependencyMonitor {
  private metrics = {
    vulnerabilityCount: new Gauge('dependencies_vulnerabilities_total'),
    outdatedCount: new Gauge('dependencies_outdated_total'),
    licenseViolations: new Gauge('dependencies_license_violations_total'),
    memoryUsage: new Gauge('dependencies_memory_usage_bytes')
  };

  async monitorDependencies(): Promise<void> {
    const vulnerabilities = await this.scanVulnerabilities();
    const outdated = await this.checkOutdated();
    const licenses = await this.validateLicenses();
    
    this.updateMetrics(vulnerabilities, outdated, licenses);
    
    // AI-powered anomaly detection
    await this.detectAnomalies();
  }
}
```

### Automated Update Management
```yaml
# Enhanced Dependabot configuration
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 15
    reviewers:
      - "backend-team"
      - "security-team"
    labels:
